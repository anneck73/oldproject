howToHost.text: '<h1>The 10 Commandments of Good Hosting:</h1>
                    <p>1. Treat your guests as you would like to be treated as a guest.</p>
                    <p>2. A complete profile is a good profile.</p>
                    <p>3. If you don''t already have a PayPal account, please create one quickly –>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com">www.paypal.com</a></p>
                    <p>4. Describe your meal as precisely as possible.</p>
                    <p>5. Let your guests know what you want to offer them to drink.</p>
                    <p>6. Prepare as much as possible to avoid unnecessary stress.</p>
                    <p>7. Be careful about possible allergies and intolerances of your guests.</p>
                    <p>8. A successful meal depends on the feel-good factor, your own and that of your guests.</p>
                    <p>9. You don''t have to put up with everything from your guests - your home, your rules.</p>
